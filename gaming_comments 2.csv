Tbh there are a lot of much more talented ppl on yt doing reviews than in those publications. You put way too much weight on something that is rapidly becoming an irrelevant part of the game industry. Review sites are falling one by one cus they can't turn a profit. Ppl aren't interested in what they have to say. 

Also, you have no idea who I am so don't assume I'm some fanboy raging over games. I've probably played games for longer than most of these reviewers have been alive. 
Consider this as well. What does a 0/10 ""review"" tell you? To me, that isn't a review but rather a message to the developer that this particular fan is displeased with something they did. It obviously shouldnt be considered an actual review but it also shouldn't be discredited as just some online troll. 

storytelling is execution of story, its just another word for it. And listen, I'm not saying the story was bad bcus it was ramping up. Quite the opposite. It was.... Decent at that point, the issue was that they completely broke the narrative after that.

And yes, if you purchase a product and don't get what you were advertised, you can take action.  This is why CDPR offered refunds on the console games, becuase if they didn't they very well could have had legal action taken (though keep in mind Pre-orders do no count as purchasing a product and are not legally protected since they can be canceled at any time).

However investing is different that purchasing a product.  What they were promised is that CDPR was going to make a game.  Investors do not invest based off Every. Single. Detail. in the game, they only care about what they believe will make them money back.  Investors act based on if they believe said product will make a certain return making their investments worthwhile.  There is no certainty on return from investments.  Similar to how you can't sue when your stock goes down on Wallstreet.  Now, there is repercussions, its why companies try so hard to keep investors happy.

But no, you are not promised a product when you invest.  Even with something like kickstarter where you are actually promised a product if the game gets made, you are not garenteed what you put money towards.

An object moves through a window. If it’s entering at 100 km/h it will exit at 100 km/h.

Now speed is not relevant in terms of physically representing something in space. If you have a ball moving towards a spaceship at 20 km/h that’s just the relative speed between the two things. You can’t really tell if it’s the ball moving or if it’s the other way around or even if they are both moving towards each other at 10 km/h.

We tend to think about it that way cause we generally use a frame of reference as the Earth, for instance, that makes it clear relative to what we refer to what talking about speed. 

Now, with the portals the momentum completed to both portals should be conserved. The momentum relative to the fist portal and the second one. 

Not doing so would cause a bunch of issues.

For instance, as others have pointed out. If the orange portal was moving at 100 km/h the box would have to exit at that same speed because that’s how fast it’s going into the other portal. Now, what happens the moment the box is out? Why would it suddenly stop? The box will have a speed of 100 km/h while exiting the portal. The reasonable thing for the box is to be shot then as in option b. 

Imagine another case. Say blue portal is the moving one. Let’s say it’s moving north, at 10000 km/h in some sort of large plane or what not. If a person would walk through the portal and then keep their initial speed in relation to the moving plane, they would crash the end of the plane at almost 10000 km/h. It makes a lot more sense to maintain momentum to both portals. Meaning to the first one walking in and to the second one on exit. 

That is actually what happens with the portals in the game. Because momentum is not only a flat value, it also has a direction. When you enter the orange portal you may then exit the blue one going in a different direction.

It's not guaranteed, and the drop rate sucks, but if you keep grinding, eventually that quest will start for you. 

The difficulty of the enemies scales up pretty high, but with good communication skills, and by playing to the strengths of each player, the game actually gets *easier.*

Now, that said, sometimes the game can get unreasonably difficult in very sudden ways. Sometimes, the game can actually kill one of the co-op player characters permanently. It's super hard when that happens, because the enemies don't scale back down in HP or DPS capability. Plus, you're usually pretty used to being able to count on your partner to come in clutch with heals when you need it -- and that, well...that isn't happening anymore. So in those cases, it may be tempting to put the game down for good.

Don't do that. It's extremely technically difficult, but you *can* learn how to slog your way through the next level or two -- and if you work at it, sometimes you can even restart the co-op quest line again in the same playthrough.

Kojima does not own Solid Snake. Hence (again) his inclusion in Pachinko machines and Bomberman R, years after Kojima left Konami. Sony is not Kojima's employer, Kojima Productions is an independent studio that signed a co-publishinh agreement for 1 game.

Yep, I remember that, too. Because it had basically zero features other than providing *any* kind of digital distribution (which was very new), and it was also a buggy bloated insecure mess. It was the thing you had to deal with in order to play your game, not something that actually provided value.

But Epic isn't starting from nothing, and this really isn't a fair comparison. It'd be like if Tesla had started out selling a [Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T) instead of a [Model S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) -- yes, the Model T was great back in 1908, but it isn't 1908 anymore, and it's not like Ford is standing still. Maybe it's unfair to expect the EGS to have everything Steam has out of the gate, but it should *at least* have the basic stuff that the industry (Steam included) has figured out we want over the past nearly-20-years it's been around, and it should at least do what it does competently.

Hopefully they do get their shit together eventually.

I didn't shit on it. His post was very much pointing to he doesn't need to get the ps5. I brought up that it's still the best way. Cause when ever somebody says that line it generally means they have no intention on getting that product.

Honesty there may be too many hypotheticals to have a set answer-  The portal shouldn’t have drag on the object itself since the portal itself isnt teathered to the object, but there would have to be some sort of speed change on exit to make the opposite true

If it's a visual-only thing: I guess I'm not too familiar with how this would be implemented. Is it client-side only or a server-side thing? We have games struggling to run as is, but now there's another system added to the processing of having to switch people's skins every single match.

An example being: I remember going through 3 PS3's and only one Xbox. PS3 arguably had better specs depending on the version that you got, which has garnered a lot of hate from me whereas the original xbox360 was a bit more rugged in build.

The word way that the PS3's ran was hard divided up forced a LOT of games to have to be tailored down to it's capacity, with a prime example being fallout:nv. The Xbox system was built more like a standard PC at the time, so it's processor allowed take to be divided out so sections that might not normally have done those processes, such as a GPU relieving a portion of a CPU's load, if even by a fraction of it's total power.

As far as build quality, the PS3 has a speaker look too it, which led to being a bit more fragile over the 360. OG 360's had a metal interior structure that allowed it to be jostled around a bit more with no negative consequences. I kept both my 360 and PS3 right next to each other in my basement bedroom, and the mild humidity that would build up caused water damage to both, but the PS3 was the only one to ultimately fail from it. As far as the 360 went, someone that was mad at me picked it up and slammed it as hard as they could on the concrete floor. The console was completely mangled, and the HDD connector was cracked, but the same thing still owed on and played games until I got a new HDD.

36 and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household.

37 Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; 38 and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. 39 Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.

Rewards
40 “Whoever welcomes you welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. 41 Whoever welcomes a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward; and whoever welcomes a righteous person in the name of a righteous person will receive the reward of the righteous; 42 and whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones in the name of a disciple—truly I tell you, none of these will lose their reward.”

&gt;35 He said to them, “When I sent you out without a purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They said, “No, not a thing.” 36 He said to them, “But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one. 37 For I tell you, this scripture must be fulfilled in me, ‘And he was counted among the lawless’; and indeed what is written about me is being fulfilled.” 38 They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” He replied, “It is enough.”

(I'm gonna preemptively reference something. If one sword is the word of God, which is the sword of the spirit.. what's the second sword?)

&gt;11 “Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

At this point I can safely say the games fucking incredible. It's just a shame there's no viable way for the servers to handle it right now. But the carrot on the stick that is server meshing is seemingly on the horizon. They are trapped in 3.xx.x until they figure it out so..  soon^^tm

With out server restrictions it's 100+fps on a 3800x+2070. And God damn the ai is awesome. Servers brings it too 30fps, and 4-5 times the server response crippling basically everything.

Pvp is solid at least, piracy is super fun game play (alas the pve players really dislike how openworld and sandbox it is, forced pvp is a thing.)

Definitely not a game yet, but it's damn playable like one. If not just for the space flight simulator. 45$ gets you access to all but the newest heavy haulers. Everything buy able in game, and fairly easily with effort. Just bring 6 core 12 thread minimum to this party.

It probably only got in since Chronicles was made with a skeleton crew as the devs were trying to make AOD and the publisher forced Chronicles on them, especially since AOD had a more skimpy wetsuit (actually like the wetsuit Crystal Dynamics would make for Underworld) but it was changed super early on to a less revealing one. (So if the devs changed a skimpy outfit for Adult Lara, I'm pretty sure they'd have changed that Chronicles cutscene if it wasn't a small skeleton crew trying to push out Chronicles as fast as possible to appease Eidos.)

Technically you also have Lara's shirt now having cleavage in LR/Chronicles, which has confirmed to been entirely due to upper management demanding it (though we don't know if this was Upper Core Design Management or Eidos management.) and is why her shirt doesn't have any cleavage in the pre-rendered Cutscenes.

The game's story is set in the year 2077 when people are practically merged with machines. They have cybernetic arms and legs and even USB ports in their head. The character you play due to story reasons have problems with their implants. As a result, there are certain glitches you experience. CD Projekt RED when above and beyond making this game as immersive as possible so you as a player experience those glitches too in the most unpredictable ways. Sometimes you'll see cars sunk halfway inside the sidewalk, or maybe you'll see your character's pecker clipping through your clothes in the inventory screen. Or maybe some enemies will be standing in a T pose. Some Naysayers would argue that those are quote-unquote ""bugs"". But those are just people who don't understand the artistic choice made with this project.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, CD Projekt RED's dedication to making 'Cyberpunk 2077' the most immersive RPG ever doesn't end there. They went even farther than that. During the events of the story, something happens that puts your character's life on a timer. You are dying. But being the clever devils that they are CDPR didn't really enforce this in the game world. You can still go around, do sidequests, collect items, and forget about your condition... Or can you? CDPR dedication to immersion made it so that when your save file size exceeds 8MB the save becomes corrupt forever. Meaning that if you just dick around and neglect your condition, you risk your save file becoming corrupt. Making your race against the clock in the game much more meaningful. Again. Some people who can't appreciate art would say this is a ""bug"" that would cause unaware players to lose hours of progress. Nay, I say.

&gt;We have more terrible mainstream games today than we did back then

We had just as much shovelware and shit games. The PSX-Ps2 era was the era of every single movie ever having a tie in game made at a super low budget, designed for the lowest common denominator of players. . .We just don't remember those games, because it was 20 years ago, and that's my point.

&gt; Plus games back then still have stellar replay ability that games today dont

But you're generalizing again. 

I'm not saying this console generation is better. I actually agree that **for me personally** I can play Mega Man X a dozen times a year and not get bored, and don't have the same value in anything I played recently. . But that only makes it anecdotally true.

For people who want to just play games, then consoles are less hassle, top end graphics, and OS' built specifically specifically streamlining menus and features. When was the last time a Playstation had to go through a Microsoft Windows update, or that you got a Norton Anti-virus prompt that you can't turn off since your subscription ran out, or any of the other annoyances that come with running your gaming through a tertiary OS on your PC. And it's not like gaming consoles are obsolete in a year or two. For $300-400, you can get a dedicated gaming console that will last you (and play AAA level at industry standard graphics) for nearly a decade... gaming consoles product life cycle pretty much make them the clear-cut winner if the user only cares about simple gaming experience. PC gaming is essentially a hobby in itself (building it, upgrading it, keeping up with the tech). All that is part of the PC gaming experience. Anyone who just wants to play games on a dedicated streamlined OS, and is fine with shelling out a couple hundred dollars once or twice in a decade...then the console is the easiest answer.

That's my take. If you don't want to go down the rabbit hole hobby that is PC /building/gaming, then get a console. It will serve you just fine for 5-7 years (which is longer than any non-upgraded PC will last you).

If consoles were on ""laptop"" product life cycle where you get 2-3 years of top end use and and it's just sorta obsolete, then yeah, a desktop gaming PC is the winner hands down.

Lots of fighting games also have a large number of unique playable characters, and some games even combine lore universes to provide even more. Racing games allow you to pick from dozens of playable vehicles. Games like call of duty provide packs that give you access to different cosmetic character, allowing you to play as lots of different operators. And since the guns/perks/etc you're using are also fully customizable, there's a ton of options in those games. In final fantasy, and other strategy based games like dragon quest, you play as lots of different characters and can choose your party, like pokemon.

That said, Series X is by far my favorite.  Quick resume, super fast boot up, the UI, the backwards compatibility, auto HDR, and more features make gaming the best its been in generations - even for previous games.

I also love the accessibility features, amazing that they went all in on making people with a wide range of disabilities able to play, from the adaptive controller to even how they package the console itself.

Then it has insane value on top of that, with backwards compatibility, not upcharging for their own games across generations, free cloud saves, owning the game across PC/mobile/console, and of course game pass.

I play more games now, and save more money, than going all the way back to Atari.  I can't imagine lighting money on fire by going back to a $60 or $70 game model.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I did end up fine tuning it to get better range of volume while simultaneously reducing the noise, just a simple **noisegate** that only activates in the strictly necessary frequencies for human voice (it lets every frequency pass, it just uses that range for detecting when to open, it took me all of thirty seconds to google it and tread the first wikipedia article) and after it added an **eq**  that also cuts off a little bit of the frequencies at the top and bottom and a **compressor** (I want to use a limiter I just don't know how to use them, I know crap about technical stuff), and some **gain** to bump up the volume. I added those free plugins from **reaper** and used **equalizer apo** to apply them globally, so that's what every application in windows thinks the micrphone sounds like.

&amp;#x200B;

All of that is free, though I'm having trouble finding software to do the same on linux, since I want to ditch windows as much as I can.

I did a comparison and it sounds waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better than the ai thing from discord while getting rid of almost all of the noise. The only downside is that it took me like half an hour to figure out and google the necessary things to make it happen. It also doesn't do much (but it still does some) for noise that happens at the same time as you're speaking, so if that's inevitable you might want to turn the thing on anyways.

[],,crowqueen,,,[],,,,text,t2_dhh4q,False,False,,"Accountants do that for the most part. Games aren't a public service; they're not even a utility like water or electricity. They're a luxury good, so noone is going to set up a regulator to make sure a private, commercial company is running its business directly to the whims of people on a forum. 

They do have fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders, which align with consumer demands more than you think (if consumers aren't happy, the company won't be profitable, meaning the shareholders have their money at risk, and corporate legislation is there to protect investments such that a company can't take money from investors and do a complete bunk with it), but which is more nuanced than 'consumers good, shareholders bad'. For one thing, shareholders have a much larger stake in a company's bottom line even than a gamer who paid £150 for a collector's edition. For another, shareholding is likely to be a part of things like pension funds, meaning that actually for a twenty year old gamer it's a bummer that their £150 went up in smoke, but for a sixty year old anticipating retirement, their income after they become too old to work . And that 20 yo gamer is probably going to be that 60 yo gamer who relies on shareholders knowing the difference between 'omg GREEEEEEED' and accounting issues. Company reports are publicly available to protect people with investments in companies not all decisions make sense to consumers, but with a little more education, particularly for YouTube pundits, I think gamers could pick their battles better.

Honestly, I'm getting deja vu here from having spent years explaining this on ebay forums and writing forums, but at least here gamers are the end consumers rather than, yknow, wannabe businesspeople. Maybe basic management accounting should be taught at primary/elementary school. It would save so much aggro later on and actually help consumers make decisions in the long run that don't end up biting the hand that feeds them, such as encouraging piracy and thereby starving the devs of sales they need to show their investors -- publishers like, say, EA -- that them putting up cash is a better idea than, say, pumping a ton of money into games that somehow 'nobody wants' or are 'anti-consumer' but somehow make more money than those games that the hard-core gamers champion. 

Thing is, gamers on forums and on YouTube represent a very vocal minority. The way of making an impact is through your wallet, but even then, the majority of people who play games (as opposed to 'gamers') tend not to notice what's going on or why it happens that way and so neglect the only way they can actually make an impact.",,,1637234940,{},hl3xed4,False,t3_qwmfrg,False,True,t1_hl3qif0,/r/gaming/comments/qwmfrg/if_developers_are_going_to_halfass_games_then/hl3xed4/,,1,True,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,,0,[],,,,False,4c7bd87b518617b98a31fd9889a5345727f3dd76,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1637234958.0,False,r/gaming,public,

When graphically demanding games like these get ported to PC, a plethora of settings are added to take the game far above and beyond what a console is able to do. For example:

Draw distance/LOD  
Shadow resolutions  
Far and near shadows  
Foliage density  
Texture resolution (games at 1080p/1440p/4k can still have 8k or 16k textures)  
Anti-aliasing (not really needed usually at 4K, but a small amount of AA can help smooth out even at 4k)  
Volumetric clouds  
Lighting quality/intensity  
Reflections  
Tesselation  
AO/SSAO  
RTX

And many more things I probably forgot. Almost all of these settings are not configurable on a console, and thus they are set the same for every console. Usually these correspond to low to medium settings when the game is ported to PC (confirmed by taking side-by-side shots of PC image vs console image and seeing at which setting they align).

RDR2 on console for example, has the vast majority of settings on low or medium, a handful of them on high and quite a few of them on a setting even below low (the low graphic fidelity could not be replicated on PC). PC adds ""very high"" and ""ultra high"" to these settings.

Now, most console players probably don't care at all about this. They're happy they can play their favourite games at 4k60 on their huge TVs. That's understandable. But it's kind of a matter of not knowing what you're missing out on until you actually experience it. Since I am primarily a PC gamer, I can go and play GoT now on PS5, but it would feel like a subpar experience to me, because I know how much better the game will look once it comes to PC and I can switch all these settings to max. I don't want my first playthrough for this game to be (from my perspective) on shitty graphics.

Games on PC can look so real nowadays, due to how far GPU technology has come, that one of the primary ways to feel immersion is to have the feeling that you're actually there, seeing the world through your own eyes. Instead of seeing it on a screen. For me, immersion is paramount, because I primarily play RPG/ActionRPG/Action Adventure games, usually open world ones.

I also saw some footage of the mythical beasts you mentioned, then in Valhalla the protagonist can ride a giant wolf of norse legend… these elements goes against the basic premise of simulating a “real” historical setting, but with a heavy dose of sci-fi at the end. In Black Flag, if my memory is correct, 90% of the game is based on the romanticized pirates doing their thing… but at the very end, you find a super technological base hidden in a tropical island… that’s good enough imo, you don’t need to go beyond that.

There is one fundamental difference.
In the portal situation shown in this post, the object is stationary.

A stationary object cannot traverse a stationary portal, or stationary doorway.

If we use a real life doorway as an example, then the only way to have one side moving and one side stationary is to have a corridor getting longer, with the entrance moving towards you and the exit staying still.

How does the object get out?
How do you go through a doorway exit if both you and the doorway exit are not moving?

The only way for the object to go through the stationary exit is if the object is actually moving.

See this is where I disagree. That speed will be conserved *while* the top piston is moving around it. Once the top piston stops moving because it hit the platform, that entire ""universe"" stops moving to match the velocity of the cube.

Here's another example. Lets say that only 3 things exist in the entire universe. A perfectly rigid platform, a cube sitting on it, and an empty room with an opening. All 3 of these things have no velocity if looked at alone. There isn't any relative velocity until we look at both the room moving toward the cube AND the cube.

Now lets say that empty room comes flying across the universe toward our cube which is sitting on the platform and ""englufs"" the cube before slamming into our perfectly rigid platform. A platform which cannot vibrate or transfer any energy to the cube. Tell me why would would the cube leave the platform? Because that's what you are saying would happen in this hypothetical portal situation. All that would happen is that we've got a relative velocity between the cube and the room all the way up until the room stops moving and at that exact moment all velocities become 0.

It's the same either way. This is Einstein's theory of relativity. It makes no difference whatsoever if you say ""the platform isn't moving, the piston is"" or ""the piston isn't moving, the platform and the rest of the universe is"". Ditto for the cube and the exit portal. Pick a frame of reference that makes it easy to figure out what's happening and it's all equally valid. (Weird things can happen, like disagreeing on whether one thing happens before another, but neither one is wrong, they're just both true from different points of view.)

In this case, it's easiest to imagine standing still next to the exit, which is also still relative to you, and seeing what happens. The room, platform, and cube all come flying at you very fast, is what, and the cube keeps going until something stops it.

It's not like a hula hoop because with a hula hoop, the entrance and exit, so to speak, move together.

And then there's its spiritual sequel Crimson Dragon, an Xbox One exclusive launch title made by many of PD's creators that even most PD fans haven't heard about to this day.

But I heavily recommend the remake, it's available for most modern platforms and it goes on sale often on all of them.

Not really.  Going rate for data transit is about $5/Mbps/mo.  Let's say you allow the file to have 250Mbps, so it takes an hour to download.  At that rate, you've used $1.65 of bandwidth. Even if you have one server per file download, that server is only about $2000.  Spread that over 3 years and rack it in a rack, which is about $50 month.  So that's $2.70 an hour for the server, plus the bandwidth.

Total cost of server and bandwidth for a 100GB download is $4.35.

I haven't included staffing yet, but I assume staffing is probably cheaper for one server admin for a fleet of servers than for all the people you need to operate, maintain, load, and unload a CD press, a jewel case maker and press, a shipping department, to package them all up, a printing press to make the boxes, and all the other stuff I didn't think of.

[],,dnew,,,[],,,,text,t2_3gkre,False,False,,"&gt; I'm comparing it to the cost to package a disc and put it on a shelf.

You can't really include the cost of paying rent on a building as part of the distribution costs. At some point, you need to say ""this is the incremental price of the game."" If WalMart takes 20% of the price of the game, that's fair to include as part of the distribution costs, but only because you're paying someone else to distribute it.

Basically, I'm saying the cost to distribute the game is far lower than the cost of having someone else sell the game for you. It would be like saying ""it costs $20 to deliver the game"" because Steam charges you 30% of the retail price. No, it still costs a dime to deliver the game and $19.90 for Valve's profit.

The cost of putting your own disk on your own shelf is small. The cost of renting someone else's shelf is large. The latter, of course, is what affects the price of a game, but it's not really something you can put a specific number on.

&gt; You pay per every request to GET/PUT/DELETE a file 

That's measured in thousandth's of cents per operation. 

In any case, my point is that the cost of *selling* the game is many  orders of magnitude greater than the cost of storing or delivering it. The cost of clearing the credit card charge is several times larger than the cost of actually transferring the bits. Anyone thinking that the difference in game price between physical games and digital games is due to the price of creation, storage, or delivery is unaware of just what a tiny percentage of that is compared to actually advertising and collecting money for the games.",,,1640923962,{},hqn3lp3,False,t3_rshdjp,False,True,t1_hqn0dsh,/r/gaming/comments/rshdjp/too_true/hqn3lp3/,,1,True,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,,0,[],,,,False,c1af2f9b039b3445a64a3c988767cb1a29e6d610,True,False,,0.0,0.0,1640923979.0,False,r/gaming,public,

You don't 'have' to eat and stuff, though you definitely want to, Repairing tools costs nothing but you need to use a workbench for it, and another big one with everyone is that you get all materials back on 'deconstructing' things, so you can build/experiment etc. freely.

Trash talk was a BIG part of playing in-person. Sometimes it goes too far, but generally it's a part of the game when you're being competitive. It's the same with other games/sports. Have you ever played pickup bball? Good luck not getting roasted by every teenager that can shoot half decent lol.

Personally, I'm old (early 30s xD) and generally don't have interest in trash talk online, but growing up with it - random people throwing out insults doesn't impact me at all.

I would argue that if someone is playing games online and gets enraged by simple insults - they have other much more notable issues in their home/school/work life that should be addressed.

Most definitely, I had a little Ryzen 2200G with the Vega 8 in it which I have since passed on to a friend in need, it ran a surprising amount of my games pretty well, well enough to serve the needs of the average casual gamer, at least. Certainly enough to wipe away the tears and/or nightmares from the Intel Integrated Graphics days, anyway. And this was on a simple Ryzen 3/Vega 8, I can only that the more powerful models would perform better.

That's the only thing I ever really expected from an integrated graphics chip really, somewhat passable performance so that I least have a few options if I find myself without a GPU, whereas in my experience, most of the integrated options pre-Ryzen meant you were pretty much screwed as far as gaming goes, as far as any modern games were concerned. That little Ryzen did an admirable job with everything except for my most performance-intensive games, Metro Exodus was one of them at the time.

Its simply easier for some people to do one and others to do the other, both would have to think if forced with the other option. 

Another case to think about is diving in a 3D platformer - you run forward with forward tilt of stick so when you get in the water does it make sense to press backward tilt as down or to press forward? Nowdays games like Mario Odyssey decided its a button press. Sunshine decided to have buttons repressent up and down.

Its all very interesting when you think about it. Wasn't an insult or arguing that only one is right by saying ""true 3D"" its just a label and would call the other something like ""direct translation"".

Glad that someone actually took the time to think about it and reply something meaningful rather than just get upset over it.

FPS/RTS Hybrid.

Most everyone is playing an FPS game. You try to capture control points which secure resources for your team, while trying to push forward and eliminate the enemy's bunker.

One player on each team is the commander. The commander allocates the resources gathered by the team in order to build structures, provide upgrades, and unlock different loadouts for the FPS players.

When you had a good team, it was great. FPS players would have some shootouts over resource stations while the commanders would provide new respawn points, resupply stations, or auto-turrets to zone enemies. Once a commander upgraded their team to have access to siege weapons (railguns, rockets, explosives), the FPS players could elect to flank buildings - if an FPS player could put a dent in an enemy's power relay, it could cause the enemy's buildings to go offline until a new one was built, shutting down aggressive respawn points. You could even try and sneak up on the enemy commander; if you creep into their bunker and kill them, that would put all building on hold until the commander respawned, and I've had some rare shootouts against people trying to kill me while I was commander myself.

The game had some flaws, sure - losing games could drag on forever since there was a strong defender's advantage but no recovery mechanics, and I think the game could have stood to have a TF2/Fortnite stylized art instead of being the muddy military shooter that it was, but I feel the game deserved more than a 71 on metacritic.",,,1617402796,{},gt6s24x,False,t3_mikute,False,True,t3_mikute,/r/gaming/comments/mikute/so_what_is_it/gt6s24x/,1617402806.0,1,True,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you filtered for 30+ in a social video game, it's going to have higher proportion of women, I can believe it. However I don't know about this game, isn't it niche?

&gt;Only reason why gaming is by many seen as something men do is only because of marketing that is still in previous decade.

Nah. Big games know how to attract women, they're still a minority. Because video games aren't stimulating to women like it is to men...

Also, when something does change the functionality for the better and is added at a premium to said list of items it makes it worse. 

Another thing that makes them worse is, if you sold said handle wrap, and pushed it and pushed it until people thought they had no choice but to buy it, as is done by most devs.

If you're going to sell wraps, or even stuff to make the knife better, fine, but don't do it in a gambling way, and don't do it in a way that makes people feel like they HAVE to have it. 

As for DLC, there are tons of cases of DLC that is great. The only times I have issues with paid DLC is when it is released to ""finish"" the game. The Sims packs are a prime example. As are the Pokemon Sword and Shield DLCs. But, the DLCs for like, The Witcher 3 are good. 

See, I'm not saying I disagree with companies adding new cosmetic things and making money from them, what I disagree with is when they add it to a gambling style loot box.

With the Isu story line, going back further in time only helps reveal that ""sci-fi-ness"" due to being closer to the Isu era. I think people forget what the over arching storyline for AC consisted of; an ancient race called the isu who created humans as slaves and then failed to prevent the sun from killing them all. The most recent games, especially Odyssey, take place much closer to the Isu era. Therefore, they naturally have more remnants of this within the story and world.

What happened was the console was too expensive and difficult to develop games upon.  What turned the console around was Sony's redesign that removed several features, stripping it down to just PS3 games and software and the Blu-ray player, reducing the price to compete against the X360.  Further, game developers were now getting their game engines to a decent point.

Sony learned a lesson with the PS3's original failure and used it for designing the PS4.  The reason Sony and Microsoft moved to x86 based CPUs after this generation was due to many game engines and software support already made for the x86-based PC market.

- Dont Starve Together:
I play that game alone but its pretty fun dying over and over and slowly mastering the randomly generated world.

- Apex Legends:
Its a FPS made by the folks who made Titanfall 1 and 2, interesting Lore and Characters its a Battle Royale with 3 Player Squads or Duos, and in the new Season There is also the new 3v3 Arena Gamemode.

- The Forest:
Havent played it myself but was sitting in a Discord with my friends while they played it.

- It Takes Two
Although it can only be played by 2 Players.

It's also a very trolly game, early on a ton of pokemon have poison and you aren't flush with cash, so if you're trying to level up to the gym that means a stupid amount of trips back and forth to the poke center.

Feels like there's really only like five enemies in the game, bokoblins, lizalfos and moblins, then their undead counterparts. There were other enemies too like the evil ninjas, lynels, etc. But it felt like I rarely ever saw them. Guardians also had specific locations.

It is free to play.  You can spend money to advance in the game, or you can grind for the in-game currency, so... anything available to someone with cash, is also available to someone who wants to ""work"" for it instead.  It really is Free To Play.  There are perks with spending a little money.. first actual purchase of game currency adds another character slot and changes your account to ""Premium"" forever.  You can get more character slots with game currency as you go.  But all the new lands and quests, and whatever else might interest you... are available, should you decide to grind your way through.

The Devs, in the forums, actually recommend dedicating one of your character slots to a ""New"" character.  You start some race/class combination you've never tried (or one you know well.. totally up to you) and you quickly blaze through all the introductory ""deeds"" to collect the game currency.  Then, you delete the character, make a new one, and do it all again.  The introductory ""deeds"" have very light requirements (kill 10 something instead of kill 150, etc).  It helps people familiarize themselves with how the other races and classes are played, so that when you choose to play with others in the game, you better understand what their characters bring to the joint quest.  And earns you the Turbine points to purchase the next land and quest pack.

I also do not like that they did not have a 3rd planet to go to. You essentially got Monarch and that first planet that also has the capital city on it. The rest of the game is a series of side jaunts. Its a quaint small story in a big story package. I guess it was just a lack of content that kind of irritated me.

That being said what Outerworlds did have is decent dialogue and somewhat likeable characters. It was good enough for me to beat it twice on increasing difficulty but there was not enough content in the game. But I may be being harsh as I believe it retailed at launch lower priced than Cyberpunk. Eh in any case those were my gripes.

[],,ziptofaf,,,[],,,,text,t2_8e3wg,False,False,[],"Honestly I agree. I found **actual** gameplay in Witcher 3 to be really underwhelming and repetitive. It's storyline was very satisfying and visuals were great, sure. But stuff like combat? Uhh, no. It was extremely repetitive and essentially boiled down to mashing your mouse. If you upped the difficulty to the max enemies just got more hp and hit harder so from time to time you even needed to take some elixirs but that's about it. 

Want to take an enemy on higher level than yourself? You can't, you **will** get one shotted. Similarly lower level enemies proved to be 0 challenge whatsoever. Both severely limiting which quests you could pick. 

There is not all that much merit in exploring on your own - as you noticed, there are no NPC interactions and all places you should be in both cases are highlighted on your map. That's something that first Deus Ex, Gothic or Morrowind did much better as exploring actually yielded benefits - in the forms of hidden dialogues that you could use for your advantage later, treasures and interesting side gigs. 

Funnily enough Cyberpunk in terms of raw gameplay is better than Witcher 3 however as you do have more options available - stealth mechanic is not designed well but it does give an alternative to mowing down everything in your path. Different guns also do play a bit different (until you invest points into them, then everything is OP and becomes more similar as you get huge boosts to reload times, damage and stability). ""Mage"" build (aka quickhacks) also opens up some interesting options (spreading suicide + cyberpsychosis = rooms clean themselves). Ironically the main aspect of Witcher 3 combat (melee combat) is however broken beyond belief in Cyberpunk (just try that katana only playthrough, turns out animations get stuck and your weapon doesn't really like hitting opponents).",,,1608642764,{},ggosu3i,False,t3_ki4ssa,False,True,t3_ki4ssa,/r/gaming/comments/ki4ssa/as_a_fan_of_witcher_3_cyberpunk_lived_up_to_my/ggosu3i/,1608642775.0,1,True,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[],,lemonylol,,,[],,,,text,t2_68pg4,False,False,[],"Honestly though, I don't think it's purely nostalgia, I really there are far fewer, high quality games that came out in the last 5 years, compared to anything released from like 1995-2015. And it makes sense when you think about it, because online-only and competitive-only games have completely dominated the market. Yes, there are quality single player games still available, but they're so far and wide in between, where generations like the PS2, 360, Gamecube, and even PC games up to 2015 or so, had a brand new, original IP, very high quality game coming out like almost every month.

I can literally just list out the games that have come out in the past 5 years that have been up to this quality standard:

- Doom/Doom Eternal
- REmake 2/3
- Arkham Knight
- Bloodborne
- MGS V
- The Witcher 3
- Dark Souls 3
- Breath of the Wild
- RE7
- Mario Odyssey
- Cuphead
- RDR2
- Spiderman
- Sekiro
- Modern Warfare (actually enjoyed the campaign)
- TLOU2
- Ghost of Tsushima
- Cyberpunk 2077
- God of War

EVERYTHING else has been online-only, or a game that got popular for a brief time and died. Like holy fuck, look at 2016 alone, what the fuck happened? Like There were almost as many really good video games released in 2010 *alone* as the ones I've listed above.

Both games suffer from repetitively used objectives that can become boring for even the most dedicated players and this was more noticeable in Odyssey because it's a much larger world. However, the combat in Odyssey felt more challenging to me and I can remember being scared of the bounty hunters there while the ones in Valhalla were just a nuisance after you could beat one you could beat most of them (and their existence doesn't make as much sense in the story).

Finally, I just flat out hate the characterizations in Valhalla, female Eivor especially. As someone who played as Kassandra through all of Odyssey female Eivor just seemed to lack Kassandra's more feminine aspects and instead just seemed like a male character in a female body.

At least we can discuss the game and our thoughts about it. Cyberpunk is just overwhelmed by the fact that it's an unfinished mess.

But, just in case you want more solid proof, here I am, I've given this game two chances, and I never could get too far.

The first time, I clocked in 15 hours. When I realized I had basically achieved nothing despite focusing mostly on the main quest, I quit. I get that games are a time waster, but this was time wasted even within that context.

The second time, I don't even remember how many hours I clocked in, but I managed to get past the first giant beast thing, the elephant (Val Ruta?). That was it, though. I was more willing to keep going this time, except the game screwed me over with an ingredient I needed, which I now had to go hunt to the other side of the map, and my horse was in yet a different corner of the map.

Let's not even touch on trying to get somewhere up high, or being stuck and needing to climb in order to leave, when it's raining. It's an exercise in the most insufferable frustration. Whoever had the idea of have you slide down when climbing in the rain needs to be drawn and quartered.

I must mention that the second time I played, I was in no mood for wasting time, so I cheated and gave myself a lot of stamina in order to be able to get to places and have fun exploring from the get go. Despite the main reason for quitting being BS on part of the game, I still can't say I was all that broken up about quitting. It never managed to fully grab me.

It seems to me that a big factor for lots of people enjoying it was that they weren't fatigued with the open world formula. That's our bad, the people who played a lot of Ubisoft's formulaic crap and its many imitations.

By the way, the same goes for Horizon Zero Dawn. I nearly crapped my pants when it came to PC, only to hate it a few wasted hours in. I had more fun watching a friend play Ghost of Tsushima, which I would've hated doing myself, since it's YAUG (yet another ubisoft game).",,,1622937830,{},h0qq4f4,False,t3_nt8nyg,False,True,t3_nt8nyg,/r/gaming/comments/nt8nyg/am_i_the_only_who_thinks_breath_if_the_wild_is/h0qq4f4/,1623089205.0,1,True,False,gaming,t5_2qh03,,0,[],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
